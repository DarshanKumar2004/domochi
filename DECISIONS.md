# Decisions

Small decisions made during development. Large design changes are asked about first.

## Phase 0 (2026-10-30)

- **Phaser pinned to 3.90.0.** Phaser 4 is the current npm `latest`, but CLAUDE.md specifies Phaser 3. `^3.90.0` will never pull in 4.x.
- **TypeScript 7, Vite 8, Vitest 5, Playwright 1.64.** These were the latest versions at setup time. Type checking and tests pass on them.
- **Hand-written scaffold** instead of `npm create vite`, so the layout matches the structure in CLAUDE.md without template leftovers.
- **Vite `base: './'`.** Relative asset paths work on GitHub Pages subpaths and inside Capacitor.
- **`window.__game`** is exposed so Playwright can check which scene is active.
- **Playwright runs as a Pixel 7** (mobile Chromium, touch enabled), because mobile web is the main target.
- **Ring geometry is in `src/stations/donutGeometry.ts`.** The pon de ring layout (8 balls, first at 12 o'clock, clockwise) is pure and unit-tested, and later stations will reuse it for glaze and topping hit regions.
